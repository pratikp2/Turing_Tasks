Product Backlog:

1. [High Priority] Calculate the sum of a list of numbers (O(n)) - User Story
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The algorithm should calculate the sum of all elements in the list.
     - The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(n).

2. [Medium Priority] Implement a sorting algorithm for trading data (O(nlogn)) - User Story
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The algorithm should sort the trading data in ascending or descending order.
     - The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(nlogn) on average.

3. [Low Priority] Develop a feature to detect market trends (O(m*n)) - User Story
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The algorithm should identify market trends based on historical data.
     - The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(m*n), where m is the number of data points and n is the number of features.

4. [Low Priority] Enhance error handling for API requests (O(1)) - User Story
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The system should handle API requests gracefully and provide appropriate error messages.
     - The time complexity of the error handling logic should be O(1).
